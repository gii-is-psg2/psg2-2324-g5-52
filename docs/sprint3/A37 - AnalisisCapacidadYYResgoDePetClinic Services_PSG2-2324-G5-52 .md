# Introducción

As a group, create a **technical report** (in Spanish) titled “Análisis de la capacidad y el riesgo de PetClinic Services (PSG2-2324-GX-XY)”. The technical report must be stored in a **docs** folder within the same repository using the Markdown syntax, updating the stored versions as the group works with it following the strategy defined in S1. This document **must contain** at least the following items:

  a. A reasoned and fully explained estimation of the TCO the service included in the CA, including, among other aspects, the OpEx and CapEx, considering that the service:

    i. Should be available for at least 24 months.
    ii. There should be enough capacity for offering the service to 10.000, 5000 and 3000 Basic, Gold and Platinum users, respectively.
    iii. Is supported by the development and operation ecosystem seen in class.
    iv. The average monthly number of incidents, requests, and RFCs is 120, 100 and 2, respectively.
    v. Annual salary can vary between 0.5 and 3%.

  b. An analysis of the capacity of the extended Pet Clinic service, including at least capacity results involving the maximum number of requests supported, the minimum cost incurred to support a number of requests, and the minimum time to serve a number of requests.

  c. A reasoned and fully explained analysis of operation and maintenance risks for the service included in the CA, considering:

    i. As a baseline, the conditions described for the TCO estimation.
    ii. Every 6 months, prices of external APIs may vary from 2 to 10%.
    iii. Prices of enabling and enhancing services may vary from 2 to 10%.
