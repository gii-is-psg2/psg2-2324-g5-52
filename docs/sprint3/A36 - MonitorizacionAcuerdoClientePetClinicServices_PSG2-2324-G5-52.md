# Introducción

As a group, create a **technical report** (in Spanish) titled “Monitorización del Acuerdo de cliente de PetClinic Services (PSG2-2324-GX-XY)” which sums up the work performed to monitor the CA. For each request enumerated in A3.5, this document must contain at least a report of the degree to which the associated SLT is fulfilled, as well as the time elapsed between creating the issue in GitHub and its closure. You can use screenshots of iTop and GitHub that show when the issues were opened and closed. **Each member of the group should review at least one request** and assign it to another member. The assigned member should create a corresponding issue in GitHub and implement the request, updating both the issue in GitHub and the user request or incident in iTop once it is implemented. The technical report must be stored in a **docs** folder within the same repository using the Markdown syntax, updating the stored versions as the group works with it following the strategy defined in S1.
