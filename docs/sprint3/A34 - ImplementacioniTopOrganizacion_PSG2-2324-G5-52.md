# Introducción

As a group, create a **technical report** (in Spanish) titled "Implementación de iTop para la Organización PSG2-2324-GX-XY" which sums up the work performed on iTop during this Sprint. This work includes the configuration of all iTop elements to support incident and requests management for the Petclinic services, such as Customer contracts, Services, Service subcategories, SLAs, SLTs, and Delivery models, among others. The technical report must be stored in a **docs** folder within the same repository using the Markdown syntax, updating the stored versions as the group works with it following the strategy defined in S1. The technical report **must contain** at least the following items, some of them for each service:

  a. Screenshot of the iTop portal that is available for customers (clinic owners).

  b. Difficulties that were found when configuring iTop in this scenario during the Sprint. For instance, discuss how the elements of the CA were defined in iTop, and why some could not be defined if that were the case.
  
  c. Features missing in iTop to properly register and provide information to support all the tasks of this Sprint.
  
  d. Contributions of each author. Include details on concrete tasks performed by each member of the group. We suggest using a matrix or table to sum up this information.
